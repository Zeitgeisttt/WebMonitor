# WebsiteMonitor

Inspired and based on the work of Zack Scholl and his [blog](https://schollz.com/blog/pottery).  
A version of Website Change Monitor he created using Go and Node.js can be found [here](https://github.com/schollz/websitechanges).  

This project is designed to help UCSD international students (including myself) monitor the websites of leasing offices near campus for newly available houses.  

When I was in China during the pandemic, the only way to rent houses for the Fall 2021 quarter was through leasing offices’ websites. However, demand exceeded supply. 
So I created a program that could monitor the leasing offices’ websites for newly available houses. 
The program will send you an email alerting you when a new house becomes available on leasing offices' websites, along with a screenshot of the webpage.
